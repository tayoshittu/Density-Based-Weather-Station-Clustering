# Density-Based-Weather-Station-Clustering
Weather station clustering using DBSCAN and scikit-learn. DBSCAN is especially very good for tasks like class identification in a spatial context. The wonderful attribute of DBSCAN algorithm is that it can find out any arbitrary shape cluster without getting affected by noise. For example, this following example cluster the location of weather stations in Canada. &lt;Click 1> DBSCAN can be used here, for instance, to find the group of stations which show the same weather condition. As you can see, it not only finds different arbitrary shaped clusters, can find the denser part of data-centered samples by ignoring less-dense areas or noises.

### Dataset
Environment Canada Monthly Values for July - 2015

### Visualization 
visualization of stations on map was done using basemap package
